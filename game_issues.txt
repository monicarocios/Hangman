word guess game:

javascript doesn't want to work for both the intro and game pages when their html overlaps 
so once comment out margin-top of the intro section, and the game section if below intro- it works and it fades in as needed
also can't even click on the button when they overlap 

need to find another way to make the fade in work or make the first page hide behind the second without screwing up javascript
maybe not opacity...maybe z-index would help 

or some other css thing

also in rock, paper, scissors- could experiment with this and see why it's not working

4/20/20: need to grab the right button id so that i can register which letter was guessed
I added an id to the button that reflects the letter of the alphabet that it is
maybe could watch a tutorial for this one part im stuck on cause im not sure how to grab the id- after creating the button element in javascript
or look at the example i already made on github for the word guess game

answer: because i made the buttons in the for loop, i guess the function that needs to use the buttons needs to be called inside of that for loop...

***todo: 
1) need to randomly generate words out of an array? 
2) need to check letter guessed with word and see if any of them matches
3) if it doesn't match, draw part of hangman stick figure
4) if it does match, add letter in the appropriate blank
5) if guess the word, then player score goes up

4/29/20: need to add stick figure drawing when guess correctly
need to figure out spacing in words (can look at hangman example with ones that have spaces, probably just about compressing it before comparing with array entries)
need to figure out if splitting different parts of hangman
		// body into functions works, or just using if else statements
		// for pscore and hangman bosy works better

        also need to fix canvas background changing to white after line added
        also fix disappearing line?
