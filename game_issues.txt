word guess game:

javascript doesn't want to work for both the intro and game pages when their html overlaps 
so once comment out margin-top of the intro section, and the game section if below intro- it works and it fades in as needed
also can't even click on the button when they overlap 

need to find another way to make the fade in work or make the first page hide behind the second without screwing up javascript
maybe not opacity...maybe z-index would help 

or some other css thing

also in rock, paper, scissors- could experiment with this and see why it's not working
